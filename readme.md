A fork of Facebox 1.2
=====================

Adds the ability to have the dialog open next to a particular dom element.

There is a more recent version of facebox at https://github.com/defunkt/facebox -- it is using more modern best practices for js and css3.  Maybe we'll incorporate some of that code at some point.

Original copyright header from the version we are using:
 
    Facebox (for jQuery)
    version: 1.2 (05/05/2008)
